| Urgency of Need | Immediate (within 1 month)   | 40         |
|                     | Short-term (1-3 months)  | 30         |
|                     | Medium-term (3-6 months) | 20         |
|                     | Long-term (6+ months)    | 10         |

Zapier Workflow
To automate capturing and processing leads:
1.Trigger: New form submission in Google Forms.
2.Action 1: Use Zapier's Formatter to calculate the lead score based on the rules above.
3.Action 2: Add the lead and score to a Google Sheets spreadsheet.
4.Action 3: Send a welcome email to leads with a score above 70 via Gmail.
5.Action 4: Add leads with a score below 70 to a separate Google Sheets spreadsheet for nurturing campaigns.


Task 2: Handling Edge Cases

Handling Incomplete Data
- Solution: Use Zapier's filter tool to verify if all required fields are completed before processing.
  - If any fields are incomplete, notify the sales team via email or Slack to review the lead.

Ensuring High-Value Leads Are Properly Managed
- Solution: Add a conditional logic step in the Zap:
  - For leads scoring above a threshold (e.g., 70), assign them directly to a sales representative or notify the sales team.
  - For leads scoring below 70, add them to a nurturing campaign list.

Accommodating Different Time Zones
- **Solution**: Use Zapier's Formatter to:
  - Convert the lead submission time to the sales team's time zone.
  - Ensure follow-up times are aligned with the sales team's working hours.


Task 3: Scaling and Advanced Implementation

Implementing a Lead Distribution System
- Solution:
  - Use Zapier's Formatter to distribute leads evenly among sales reps.
  - Maintain a Google Sheets spreadsheet to track the number of leads assigned to each rep.
  - Adjust assignment logic dynamically based on workload.

Extracting Keywords from Comments
- Solution:
  - Use Zapier's Formatter to split text responses into individual words.
  - Apply a keyword extraction algorithm or integrate third-party tools like MonkeyLearn for extracting relevant keywords.

Creating a Lead Follow-Up System
- Solution:
  - Add lead details to Google Calendar for follow-up scheduling.
  - Use Zapier's Formatter to calculate follow-up dates based on lead submission dates and urgency levels.
  - Send automated reminders to the sales team using email or task management tools like Trello.
